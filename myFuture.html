            <h2>Question: Where do you see yourself in x months/years?</h2>
            <p>This webpage is to describe where I see myself in the next 10 years of my life. Enjoy.</p>

        <h2 class="six">6 months</h2>
        <p>In 6 months I will have graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in Digital Sciences and a minor in Design. I know I will be working for Medical Mutual of Ohio in their downtown Cleveland office on their User Experience team. I see myself moving closer to Cleveland, probably living in an apartment. </p>

        <h2 class="one">1 year</h2>
        <p>In one year from now, I see myself still working in Cleveland for Medical Mutual and hopefully I gain a roommate one he graduates from Kent State as well. I see my self owning a cat and enjoying the city. I will also be graduating from graduate school! </p>

        <h2 class="five">5 years</h2>
        <p>Five years from now is pretty hard to predict. I dont want to plan that far ahead because I never know what opportunities will arise. I will hopefully still be working for Medical Mutual's user experience team. Still owning a cat. Hopefully have the opportunity to travel, too. Visiting Chicago again would be really nice and maybe traveling out of the country again. </p>

        <h2 class="ten">10 years</h2>
        <p>Ten years from now is even more hard to predict and see myself there because, again, I never know what opportunities may arise. Maybe I'll actually own a house near Cleveland. Maybe even thinking about starting a family, but again, it's pretty hard to predict these things.</p>
